Abstract 

This study takes a closer look at traffic accidents in Chicago, with a special focus on pedestrian and bicycle safety. The goal is to uncover patterns and factors behind these accidents to create more effective safety measures. The majority of crashes, including rear-end collisions, turning accidents, and collisions with parked automobiles, occur in moderate speed zones, particularly those with speed restrictions between 20 and 40 mph. Due to the high volume of vehicles, bikers, and pedestrians in these regions, encounters and accidents occur frequently. Although there are fewer incidents in low-speed zones (such as residential or school neighbourhoods), vulnerable road users, such as cyclists and children, are frequently involved. However, collisions at high-speed zones are more serious but less common. Compared to regions with only stop or yield signs, traffic signals significantly improve road safety by lowering the frequency and intensity of collisions. The study also investigates how weather and time of the week affect collisions. Thursdays have the most collisions, but weekends have fewer collisions but a higher likelihood of serious ones, probably as a result of riskier driving practices like speeding or intoxicated driving. Unexpectedly, weather also affects accidents. The majority of collisions occur at speed limits of 25 to 30 mph, which are typically in cities. This emphasizes the need for improved pedestrian crossing, signs, and traffic calming techniques in these congested regions. 
Using data visualizations like box plot and heatmaps the study also identifies critical trends, outliers, and correlations. By analyzing these patterns, the research offers practical insights to help reduce crashes, injuries and fatalities while improving traffic flow in Chicagoâ€™s busy streets.
